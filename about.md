I'm a second year PhD student in the [ECE department](http://www.ece.ucsb.edu/) at [UC Santa Barbara](http://www.ucsb.edu/), advised by [William Wang](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/) and [B.S. Manjunath](https://vision.ece.ucsb.edu/people/bs-manjunath). I previously completed an MS in Signal and Image Processing at [UC Santa Barbara](http://www.ucsb.edu/). Prior to UCSB, I graduated with a B.Tech(Hons.) in Instrumentation Engineering from the [Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.iitkgp.ac.in/) department at [IIT Kharagpur](http://iitkgp.ac.in/).

My general areas of research are Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. My research focuses on relation extraction for knowledge base completion. In the past I have explored Visual Question Answering, Image Classification and Image Segmentation.  

I also enjoy a life apart from academia. Outside of work, I dabble in cooking, reading good books, working out, playing tennis and soccer, dancing, and going on excursions.
