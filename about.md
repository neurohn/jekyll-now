I'm a first year PhD student in the [ECE department](http://www.ece.ucsb.edu/) at [UC Santa Barbara](http://www.ucsb.edu/), advised by [B.S. Manjunath](https://vision.ece.ucsb.edu/people/bs-manjunath). I previously completed an MS in Signal and Image Processing at [UC Santa Barbara](http://www.ucsb.edu/). Prior to UCSB, I graduated with a B.Tech(Hons.) in Instrumentation Engineering from the [Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.iitkgp.ac.in/) department at [IIT Kharagpur](http://iitkgp.ac.in/).

My general areas of research are Image Analysis and Machine Learning. More specifically, my research focuses on deriving structural information from nanometer-scale brain images.
